1.  Explain the differences between `client-side routing` and `server-side routing`.

In client-side routing, is when routing is handled internally by Javascript. Javascript manages the data for the app in its own memory, and the browser doesnâ€™t need to refresh between routes. However, the maybe data stored that the user may never access.

In server-side routing, information is requested from the server and the server retrieves that info to be displayed on the browser. This calls for a page reload, which included unnecessary requests of data (such as a the header and footer). Only the needed parts of the the total webpage are requested and retrieved at a time.
